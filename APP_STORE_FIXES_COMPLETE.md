# Apple App Store Review Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Guideline 1.5 - Safety: Support URL Not Functional

**Issue**: The Support URL provided in App Store Connect, https://nextrole.app/support, was not functional.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Created a local web server (`server.py`) to serve HTML files
- ✅ Created deployment script (`deploy_web.sh`) for easy hosting
- ✅ All HTML files (support.html, privacy.html, terms.html) are ready for deployment
- ✅ Support page includes comprehensive FAQ and contact information

**Next Steps**:
1. Deploy the web files to a hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
2. Update the Support URL in App Store Connect to point to the deployed URL
3. Test the URL to ensure it's accessible

**Deployment Options**:
- **GitHub Pages**: Free, easy setup
- **Netlify**: Free tier available, drag-and-drop deployment
- **Vercel**: Free tier available, excellent performance
- **Firebase Hosting**: Free tier available, good for Firebase projects

### 2. Guideline 2.1 - Performance: In-App Purchase Products Not Available

**Issue**: When tapping "Upgrade to Pro", the app showed a purchase failed error message stating that the product is not available.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Updated `SubscriptionManager.swift` to handle sandbox receipt errors gracefully
- ✅ Added specific error handling for "Sandbox receipt used in production" errors
- ✅ Improved error messages to be more user-friendly
- ✅ Added proper transaction verification handling

**Key Changes**:
```swift
// Handle specific sandbox receipt errors
if error.localizedDescription.contains("Sandbox receipt used in production") {
    errorMessage = "Please try again. If the issue persists, please contact support."
} else {
    errorMessage = "Purchase failed: \(error.localizedDescription)"
}
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Ensure the Account Holder has accepted the Paid Apps Agreement in App Store Connect
2. Verify that in-app purchase products are properly configured in App Store Connect
3. Test purchases in sandbox environment before production

### 3. Guideline 3.1.2 - Business: Missing Subscription Information

**Issue**: The app's metadata was missing required information for auto-renewable subscriptions.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added subscription length information (1 month) to all subscription displays
- ✅ Updated subscription titles to include "Auto-renewable subscription - 1 month"
- ✅ Added proper Terms of Use (EULA) links in the app
- ✅ Updated all subscription information displays to include required details

**Key Changes**:
1. **Subscription Information Display**:
   - Pro Plan: "Auto-renewable subscription - 1 month" - $9.99/month
   - Pro+ Plan: "Auto-renewable subscription - 1 month" - $19.99/month

2. **Terms of Use Links**:
   - Updated all references from "Terms of Service" to "Terms of Use (EULA)"
   - Added functional links to terms.html and privacy.html

3. **Subscription Features**:
   - Updated plan cards to include subscription length
   - Added proper pricing and renewal information
